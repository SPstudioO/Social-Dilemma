## Reflection
I had a lot of anxiety about this week's class topic before class. This is because I already knew that coding is a very difficult field. Nevertheless, I continued to study and approach reading courses. It was also fun to experience something new, and I was able to fall into arduino rather than my expectations before class. And I found it important to expand and combine with creative computing more than just mechanical computer coding. So I designed in combination with the elements that came to mind during the class, and I became interested in other ways of computing by comparing them with other people's results.
