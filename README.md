# Social-Dilemma
###### SIYEON PARK

Physical or creative, I didn't grow up with circuits like coding or arduino. So I'm a person who feels incredibly unfamiliar with these engineering things. Creative computing is a difficult and large field, and it took a lot of time to learn circuits. **Just keep in mind** that you have to experiment constantly. 

**_⭐️Don't worry! just keep trying and asking to work! You can do it, too!_**

#### *💡ARDUINO, what several circuits are connected to make light 🔑 SOCIAL NETWORKING ALGORITHMS, what multiple internet networks are connected to give result to users*

>>>As I learned Arduino, I noticed the connection, combination, and results of circuits and circuits. Several circuits were fixed to each position and could feel the step of connecting along the flow. I was very interested in this trend, and through this connection, a social network emerged.

## Uses of social media
+ Social networking🔑🔑
+ Messages boards
+ Social knowledge
+ Multimedia
+ Geo-location
+ Micro Blogging
+ Social book-marking
+ Podcasts
+ Online chattting

## What is social media?
+ Interactive computer-mediated technologies
+ Virtual communities
+ Networks
+ Sharing of information

Most people think of Instagram, Twitter, ect. It is right, but social media refers to open online content that is used to share one's thought, opinions, experiences, and perspectives.

## Research & Reference
#### * The Social Dilemma

Social Dilemma, a movie available on Nexflix, is a documentary film that contains warning messages by Silicon Valley experts who have developed social media platforms these days living in a modern society suffering form Social media addiction and Fake news. Tech companies such as Google, Facebook, Instagram are required to identify users and classify their propensity througth the internet. As it repeats, so people are becoming to see content that is biased toward only their interests. Even compaines that use it to take advantage of fake advertising and fake news are becoming more extreme, even though, it's mainly about tech companies that have created social media platforms are not being held accountable for this phenomenon.
#### * Positives of Social media
Unlimited use / Freedom of expression / Information acquisition / Relationships
#### * Negatives of Social media
Lack of sleep / Digital footprints / Internet addiction / Cyber bullying

## Reflection
I had a lot of anxiety about this week's class topic before class. This is because I already knew that coding is a very difficult field. Nevertheless, I continued to study and approach reading courses. It was also fun to experience something new, and I was able to fall into arduino rather than my expectations before class. And I found it important to expand and combine with creative computing more than just mechanical computer coding. So I designed in combination with the elements that came to mind during the class, and I became interested in other ways of computing by comparing them with other people's results.
